•	Analyzes URLs by validating their structure, inspecting DNS and SSL details, checking for suspicious patterns (both basic and advanced), evaluating webpage content, and integrating threat intelligence from VirusTotal and WHOIS.
•	Evaluates Emails by dissecting sender details, subject lines, and email bodies to detect urgent language, impersonation attempts, and dangerous URLs.
•	Presents Findings through a well-organized GUI that breaks down technical details and threat intelligence, providing clear risk scores and final verdicts.
•	Utilizes External Data Sources and custom detection rules to provide a comprehensive risk assessment while maintaining high responsiveness through multi-threading and careful error handling.
